# Nanoprocessor

This repository contains the VHDL source files and the implementations of a 4 bit Nanoprocessor. This nanoprocessor is capable of executing 4 basic instructions and perform basic arithmetic operations. 

## Directory Structure

- **[Nanoprocessor.srcs](https://github.com/Jaybro-git/Nanoprocessor/tree/master/Nanoprocessor.srcs/sources_1/new)** : This directory contains all the source files related to the nano processor project (still creating the files).

## Getting Started

To use the VHDL files of the nanoprocessor in this repository,

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Open Vivado and create a new project.

3. Add the VHDL files from the cloned repository to your project.

4. Customize and configure the design as needed.
